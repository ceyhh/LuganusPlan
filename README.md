# Luganus Plan
# A open source basic java chatting application

#### Thanks to Alpha Garden for SSL-TLS example [TLS EXAMPLE](https://github.com/AlphaGarden/SSL-Client-Server) I used his example to do TLS part.
#### This project has some AI tools usage such as Copilot and CHATGPT

## Properties of Project
### Client Side

# If you want to sent client side to other computers: 
- Client side runs with Main.java in order to run it you should run Protoip1\target\Prototip1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
- Also you should run it with the same direction as client-certificate.p12 and server-certificate.p12 in Prototip1\target\classes
- You should write server's public ip and port to connect.
- There is no register screen so you have to get your password and username from server side.


# Otherwise
- You are running server and client locally I suppose
- Just running Prototip1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the normal direction is ok
